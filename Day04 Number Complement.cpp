/* Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation. 

Examples:
	Input: 5
	Output: 2
	Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

	Input: 1
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
